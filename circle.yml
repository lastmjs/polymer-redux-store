machine:
    node:
        version: 8.0.0

dependencies:
  override:
    #- npm install # install all npm dependencies
    #- npm install --only=dev # install all npm devDependencies (necessary because the NODE_ENV is set to production, and if NODE_ENV is set to production npm install will only install dependencies)
    #- npm install --dev
    - npm install
    - npm install -g bower # install bower globally so that we can install our bower packages
    - bower install # install our bower packages (this will go away once Polymer is supported on npm)
